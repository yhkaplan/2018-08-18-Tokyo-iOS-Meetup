# A Look at Command Line Swift

---

# Intro
- Me
	- I work at GMO Pepabo on "Minne"
- GitHub Contributions
	- [Danger-swift](https://github.com/danger/danger-swift)
	- [vim-xcode](https://github.com/gfontenot/vim-xcode)
	- [swiftformat-script](https://github.com/yhkaplan/swiftformat-script)
	- [LattnerBot](https://github.com/yhkaplan/LattnerBot)

---

# What is a script
- A program without a GUI that has a only a few set options
	- Not a Mac app (has a GUI)
	- Not grep (too many options)
- Examples
	- Release.swift
	- Format.swift

---

# When to use a shell script
- When covered with common Unix programs

# When not to use a shell script
- External packages/libraries
- Long
- Frequent changes

---

# Comparison of Swift with Ruby and Python
- Type safety
- Concurrency
	- Python has it
	- Swift relies on GCD or lower level APIs
	- Go seems like a good choice
- Documentation

---

# Comparison continued
- Portability
	- Pyenv
	- Rbenv
	- [Swiftenv](https://github.com/kylef/swiftenv)
- Tooling
	- Reliance on Xcode
- Package management

---

# SPM
- Strengths
	- Similarity to Bundler and pip
- Weaknesses
	- Commands are long
		- `swift package generate-xcodeproj`
		- Fixable w/ alias
	- Package.swift is very verbose

---

##### Example of Package.swift file

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "LattnerBot",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "LattnerBot",
            targets: ["LattnerBot"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
		.package(url: "https://github.com/JohnSundell/ShellOut.git", from: "2.0.0"), // Shell commands
        .package(url: "https://github.com/kylef/Commander.git", from: "0.8.0"), // CLI tool
        .package(url: "https://github.com/SlackKit/SlackKit.git", from: "4.1.0") // Slack interaction
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "LattnerBot",
            dependencies: ["Commander", "ClocWrapper", "Output"]),
				// More targets
        .testTarget(
            name: "OutputTests",
            dependencies: ["Output"]),
    ]
)
```

# General good fits for Swift cli
- iOS development team
	- Shared language
	- No whiplash from switching languages
- One person devs
	- Donâ€™t work with a scripting language often

---

# Bad fits for Swift cli
- Supporting a non-Swift codebase
	- Shared flow w/ non-Swift team
- Lots of concurrency
- Cross platform portability
	- No Windows support
	- Unclear, undocumented Linux support
		- SPM
- Lots of string manipulation

---

# How to make a Swift script or cli app

---

# Executable
```swift
#!/usr/bin/swift

import Foundation
// ...
```

---

# Tasks/process

```swift
@discardableResult
func shell(_ command: String) -> Int32 {
    let args = command.components(separatedBy: " ")

    let process = Process()
    process.launchPath = "/usr/bin/env"
    process.arguments = args
    process.launch()
    process.waitUntilExit()

    return process.terminationStatus
}
```

---

# Arguments

```swift
var filePath: String?
var configFile: String?

let args = ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments
args.enumerated().forEach { index, arg in
    switch arg {
    case "--path":
        filePath = args[index + 1]
    case "-p":
        filePath = args[index + 1]

    case "--config":
        configFile = args[index + 1]
    case "-c":
        configFile = args[index + 1]

    default:
        break
    }
}
```

---

# Putting it all together

```swift
let disabledRules: [String] = [
    "consecutiveSpaces",
    "trailingSpace",
]

guard let filePath = filePath else {
    print("Missing --path/-p flag"); exit(1)
}

print("Running Swiftformat")
shell("swiftformat --disable \(disabledRules.joined(separator: ",")) \(filePath)")

guard let configFile = configFile else {
    print("Missing --config/-c flag"); exit(1)
}

print("Running Swiftlint Autocorrect")
shell("fd . -0 --full-path \(filePath) -e swift -x swiftlint autocorrect --config \(configFile) --path")
```

# Predictions for the future
- A general shift from Ruby to Swift for iOS tools
	- Cocoapods vs Carthage
	- Fastlane
	- Danger
- A community-led approach without much focus by Apple
	- Perhaps more documentation
- A potentially significant influx of community support from server side swift and Swift for Tensorflow

---

# Swift features
- Async-await
- Native regex
- Python and Ruby interop
- Better SPM
- Better string subscripting (never)

# Questions for audience
- Do you use Swift for anything other than iOS, what?
- Do you prefer a language other than Swift for scripting or cli apps, which one?
